# Combination-of-Segmentation-and-Depth-map-Estimation-



## Detail of Project

In This project we combined the power of Yolo Family for Segment objects in the given Frame of Video with Depth anything Model and Tested on Nvidia RTX 4090.

## What is segmentation?
Semantic segmentation is a deep learning algorithm that associates a label or category with every pixel in an image.
